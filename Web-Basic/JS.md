### DOM
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM
- The ```DOM (Document Object Model)``` is an ```API``` that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML document. 
- The DOM is a document model loaded in the ```browser``` and representing the document as a ```node tree```
- each ```node`` represents part of the document (e.g. an element, text string, or comment).
- The DOM is one of the ```most-used APIs``` on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to ```access and interact``` with every node in the document. 
- ```Nodes``` can be created, moved and changed. 
- ```Event listeners``` can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.

### Browser APIs 
- ```Browser APIs``` are built into your web browser, and are able to expose data from the surrounding computer environment, or do useful complex things.
