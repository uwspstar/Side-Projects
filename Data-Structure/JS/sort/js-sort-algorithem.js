There is no draft requirement for JS to use a specific sorting algorithm. As many have mentioned here, 
Mozilla uses merge sort. 
However, In Chrome's v8 source code, as of today, it uses QuickSort and InsertionSort, for smaller arrays. The ECMAscript standard does not specify which sort algorithm is to be used
