/*
Quick Sort
Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted
Works by selecting one element (called the "pivot") and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array
Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be applied on either side of the pivot
