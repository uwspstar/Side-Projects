/*
operator	    Usage	Description
Bitwise AND	    a & b	Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are 1s.
Bitwise OR	    a | b	Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either or both operands are 1s.
Bitwise XOR	    a ^ b	Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1s.
Bitwise NOT	    ~ a	Inverts the bits of its operand.
Left shift	    a << b	Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the left, shifting in 0s from the right.
Sign-propagating 
right shift	    a >> b	Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off.
Zero-fill 
right shift	    a >>> b  	Shifts a in binary representation b (< 32) bits to the right, discarding bits shifted off, and shifting in 0s from the left.

/*

Bitwise shifting any number x to the left by y bits yields x * 2 ** y.
So e.g.: 9 << 3 translates to: 9 * (2 ** 3) = 9 * (8) = 72.
