### Binary tree
- Binary tree is a tree where each node can have maximum two children. 
- Since there are only two children so itâ€™s quite intuitive to call them left and right child.

```
class BinaryTreeNode {
    constructor(value) { 
        this.value = value; 
        this.left = null; 
        this.right = null;
    }
}
```
