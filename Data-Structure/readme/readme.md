- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
```
An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure 
which provides only the interface to which a data structure mush adhere to.  
the interface does not give any specific details about 
how something should be implemented or in what programming language
```
- List ( Dynamic Array, linked List)
- Queue ( Linked List based Queue, array based Queue, Stack based Queue)
- Map  (Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table)

### Complexity Analysis
- time
- space

### Big-O Notation
```
Constant Time: O(1)
Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
Liner Time: O(n)
Quadric Time: O(n^2)
Cubic Time: O(n^3)
Exponential Time: O(b^n), b>1
Factorial Time: O(n!)
```
- O(n + c) = O(n)
- O(cn) = O(n) , c >0
- f(n) = 7log(n)^3 + 15n^2+ 2n^3 + 8 // ```O(f(n)) = O(n^3)```
