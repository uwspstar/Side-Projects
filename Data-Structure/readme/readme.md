- Abstract Data Type (ADT)
```
An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure mush adhere to.  the inter face does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language
```
- List ( Dynamic Array, linked List)
- Queue ( Linked List based Queue, array based Queue, Stack based Queue)
- Map  (Tree Map, Hash Map / Hash Table)

### Complexity Analysis
- time
- space
```
Constant Time: O(1)
Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
Liner Time: O(n)
Quadric Time: O(n^2)
Cubic Time: O(n^3)
Exponential Time: O(b^n), b>1
Factorial Time: O(n!)

```
