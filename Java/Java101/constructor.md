# constructor

- Note that the constructor name must match the class name, and it `cannot have a return type` (like void).

- Also note that the constructor is called when the object is created.

- All classes have constructors by `default`: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, `Java creates one for you`. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.
