# Encryption

- MD5 (un reverse encrypt)
- DES (symmetric, same key for encryption and decryption)
- RSA (symmetric, different key for encryption and
- SSL (digital signature)

### DES vs. AES

- DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) both are the symmetric block cipher. ... The basic difference between DES and AES is that in DES plaintext block is divided into two halves before the main algorithm starts whereas, in AES the entire block is processed to obtain the ciphertext.
