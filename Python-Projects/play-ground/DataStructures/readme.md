### list (Array) 
```
The time complexity to delete the element at index i from an array of length n is O(n−i).
The same is true for inserting a new element (as opposed to updating an existing entry)
```
- When working with arrays you should take advantage on ```both ends```.
- Instead of deleting an entry (which requires moving all entries to its right), consider overwriting it.
- When operating on 2D arrays, use parallel logic for rows and for columns.
- Arrays in Python are provided by the list type.
- The key property of a list is that it is dynamically-resized, i.e., there’s no bound as to how many values can be added to it

### list vs tuple
- The tuple type is very similar to the list type, with the constraint that it is immutable.

### tuple
### Dictionary
### set
### BTS Tree
