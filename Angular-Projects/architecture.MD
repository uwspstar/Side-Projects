# Angular Architecture
- Angular encourages a modular architecture for your application where you can break down your app into specific features that can work independently of each other. 

## Typical Angular project structure
```
/my-app
├── e2e/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── module1/
│   │   │   ├── component1/
│   │   │   │   ├── component1.component.css
│   │   │   │   ├── component1.component.html
│   │   │   │   ├── component1.component.spec.ts
│   │   │   │   └── component1.component.ts
│   │   │   ├── module1.module.ts
│   │   │   └── module1.routing.module.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.css
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.component.spec.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   ├── app.module.ts

└── README.md 
```
# break down what these parts are:

- `e2e/`: This folder is used for end-to-end tests, often with a tool like Protractor.

- `node_modules/`: This directory contains all the npm dependencies for your project.

- `src/`: This is the root folder of your application codebase.

- `app/`: This directory will contain all the code related to your application, including modules, components, services, etc.

- `module1/`: This would be a feature module in your application, encapsulating related functionality.

- `component1/`: This directory would contain all files related to a specific component in this module.
- `app.component.*`: These are the files for the root component of your application.

- `app.module.ts`: This is the root module of your application.

- `app.routing.module.ts`: This file would contain the root routing configuration for your application.

- `assets/`: This folder is for static assets like images.

- `environments/`: This is used to define different environments like development, production, etc. Each environment will have a separate configuration file.

- `.editorconfig`: This file is used by various editors and IDEs for consistent coding styles between different editors.

- `.gitignore`: This file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in your project.

- `angular.json`: This file is used to configure Angular CLI.

- `package.json`: This file contains scripts, dependencies, and metadata about your project.

- `tsconfig.json`: This file is used to configure TypeScript compiler settings.

- The `src/app/` directory is where you might store things like services, constants, mock data for demo purposes, etc. For example:

- `src/app/services/`: This is where you might put all your Angular services.
- `src/app/constants/`: This is where you might define constant values that are used in more than one place in your application.
- `src/app/mock-data/`: This could be a location for mock data to be used for demos or testing.

Remember, this is a simplified structure for an Angular project. Depending on the size and complexity of your project, you might used across multiple other modules, a core module for singleton services and components that are only instantiated once, or separate directories for models, utilities, directives, pipes, etc. Here's an example of a more complex structure:

# a more complex structure:
```
/my-app
├── e2e/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── core/
│   │   │   ├── guards/
│   │   │   ├── interceptors/
│   │   │   ├── services/
│   │   │   └── core.module.ts
│   │   ├── shared/
│   │   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── directives/
│   │   │   ├── pipes/
│   │   │   └── shared.module.ts
│   │   ├── feature1/
│   │   ├── feature2/
│   │   ├── app.component.css
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.component.spec.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   ├── app.module.ts
│   │   └── app.routing.module.ts
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── environments/
│   ├── styles/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── main.ts
├── .editorconfig
├── .gitignore
├── angular.json
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── README.md 
```
- In this more advanced structure:

- `core/`: This is typically used for singleton services, guards, interceptors, and any other components that should only be instantiated once per application.

- `shared/`: This is used for components, directives, pipes, and any other code that will be reused across your application.

- `feature1/`, `feature2/`, etc: These are feature modules that contain the components, services, etc, specific to different parts of your application.

- `styles/`: This could be used for global styles, mixins, variables, etc.

Remember, how you structure your Angular application can depend on the size and complexity of the project, as well as personal or team preferences. The important thing is to keep it consistent and organized in a way that makes it easy to understand the project and find what you're looking for.
