async function f() {

    let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000)

f();

// await wonâ€™t work in the top-level code
// But we can wrap it into an anonymous async function, like this:

(async () => {
    let response = await fetch('/article/promise-chaining/user.json');
    let user = await response.json();
})();
