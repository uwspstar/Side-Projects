class range(stop)
class range(start, stop[, step])
Rather than being a function, range is actually an immutable sequence type, as documented in Ranges and Sequence Types â€” list, tuple, range.

Ranges containing absolute values larger than sys.maxsize are permitted but some features (such as len()) may raise OverflowError.
