### IAM : Identity and Access Management

- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html
- `Principal` : `Users`, `roles`, `federated users`, and `applications` are all `AWS principals`.
  - By default, a brand new IAM user has NO permissions to do anything.
  - Users are global entities.
  - use `roles` for application that run on `AWS EC2 instances`
  - Information about the principal includes the `policies` that are `associated with that principal`. In addition, a managed policy can be directly attached to your IAM Users,

---

- `federated users` : If the users in your organization already have a way to be authenticated, you can federate those user identities into AWS.
  - You can allow users to use `identity federation` to get `temporary access` to your AWS account.
- `IAM groups` : You can organize IAM users into `IAM groups` and attach `access control policies` to a `group`.
  - A user can belong to multiple groups.
  - `Groups` do not have security credentials, and cannot access web services directly.

---

- `IAM Role` : A role does not have any credentials associated with it.
  - An IAM user can assume a role to `temporarily` take on different permissions for a specific task. A role can be assigned to a federated user

---

- `Authentication`
  - To authenticate from the `console` as a user, you must sign in with your user name and password.
  - To authenticate from the `API or AWS CLI`, you must provide your `access key` and `secret key`

---

- `Authorization`
  - `Policies` types can be categorized as permissions policies or permissions boundaries.
  - To provide your users with permissions to access the AWS resources in their own account, you need `identity-based policies`.
  - `Resource-based policies` are for granting cross-account access
  - By default, all requests are denied.

---

- `Actions` or `Operations`
  - Operations are defined by a service, and include things that you can do to a resource, such as viewing, creating, editing, and deleting that resource.
- `Resource` : `policy` attached
  - Users or groups can have multiple policies attached to them that grant different permissions.

---

- IAM Users
  - use an `access key` (an `access key ID` and `secret access key`) to make `programmatic` requests to AWS.
  - An Access Key ID and Secret Access Key can only be uniquely generated once and must be `regenerated` if lost
- `CloudTrail log` records that include information about IAM identities who made requests for resources in your account.
- `IAM` and `AWS Security Token Service (STS)` are offered at `NO additional charge`.
- use IAM tags to add custom attributes to an IAM user or role using a tag keyâ€“value pair.
