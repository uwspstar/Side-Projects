### IAM : Identity and Access Management

- `Principal` : `Users`, `roles`, `federated users`, and `applications` are all `AWS principals`.
  - use roles for application that run on `AWS EC2 instances`
  - You can allow users to use `identity federation` to get `temporary access` to your AWS account.
  - Information about the principal includes the `policies` that are associated with that principal.
- `Authentication`
  - To authenticate from the `console` as a user, you must sign in with your user name and password.
  - To authenticate from the `API or AWS CLI`, you must provide your `access key` and `secret key`

- `Authorization`
  - `Policies` types can be categorized as permissions policies or permissions boundaries.
  - To provide your users with permissions to access the AWS resources in their own account, you need `identity-based policies`.
  - `Resource-based policies` are for granting cross-account access
  - By default, all requests are denied.

---

- `Actions` or `Operations`
  - Operations are defined by a service, and include things that you can do to a resource, such as viewing, creating, editing, and deleting that resource.
- `Resource` : `policy` attached

---

- IAM Users
  - use an `access key` (an `access key ID` and `secret access key`) to make `programmatic` requests to AWS.
  - An Access Key ID and Secret Access Key can only be uniquely generated once and must be `regenerated` if lost
